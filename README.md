# River

River is a dynamic wayland compositor that takes inspiration from
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) and [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).

*Note: River is currently very early in development and not ready for end users*

## Design goals

- Simplicity and minimalism, river should not overstep the bounds of a window manger.
- Dynamic window management based on a stack of views and tags like dwm.
- Scriptable configuration and control through a socket and separate
binary, `riverctl`, like bspwm.

## Development

If you'd like to participate in the development of river, please join our matrix channel:

I can often be found in the `#sway-devel` IRC channel with the nick `ifreund`
